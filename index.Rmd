####Welcome  
  
The current site keeps track of my latest publications and additionally, serves as an outlet to disseminate some of my "failed projects". I am a big believer in transparency and think that sharing data and statistical code is an absolute necessity. As such, the data and code for my studies is available on open science and the current site contains links to each. Furthermore, the filedrawer tab gives at least some indication to some of the projects that I have ran in the past but which I am no longer pursuing. 

Thank you for your interest, <br>
Never hesitate to send me an email, <br>

-  a manuscript exploring the effect of cognitive ability on moral judgment (Under Review)
-  a manuscript exploring individual differences in implicit moral rule usage (In Prep)
-  a series of studies exploring the blame/praise spectrum (Gathering Data)
