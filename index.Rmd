####Welcome  
  
Welcome to this little corner of the web I have claimed for myself. Short disclaimer: this site is still very much under construction and at the moment contains only my publication list. 

I am a big believer in transparency and believe that sharing data and statistical code is an absolute necessity. The data and code for my studies is available on open science and the current site contains links to each. Furthermore, I am planning on using this site as a platform to disseminate some of the failed studies I have ran in an effort to keep my filedrawer at least somewhat 'clean'.  
  
Thank you for your interest, <br>
Never hesitate to send me an email, <br>

-  a number of different series of studies related to scientific 'awe' (Gathering Data)
