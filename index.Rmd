####Welcome  
  
Welcome to this little corner of the web I have claimed for myself. Short disclaimer: this site is still very much under construction. At the moment, I mostly use to keep an updated publication list and as a platform for me to disseminate some of the "failed" studies that I have ran in an effort to be fully transparent about the research I am conducting.

I am a big believer in transparency and believe that sharing data and statistical code is an absolute necessity. The data and code for my studies is available on open science and the current site contains links to each. 

Thank you for your interest, <br>
Never hesitate to send me an email, <br>

-  a manuscript exploring individual differences in implicit moral rule usage (In Prep)
- a manuscript exploring the effect of cognitive ability on moral judgment (In Prep)
-  a number of different series of studies related to scientific 'awe' (Gathering Data)
